Project Description
An odd job finder is a platform independent flutter app that helps you hire people for odd jobs at home as well as apply for the same. There is a vast requirement for housekeeping services. There is no concrete method in acquiring such help other than agencies that are very expensive and do not seem to work very well. This app helps connect an individual to find odd job oppurtunites or even house keeping services located near them. The duration is flexible and the requirements are chosen by the job seeker. This app will help people get the required jobs done at a convenient method. It helps people on the move to get small jobs as well conveniently. This app will be implemented using flutter as well as firebase.

Objective
To provide a simple yet detailed user â€“ interface that

connects an individual to find odd job opportunities
connects an individual to find housekeeping services near them
create a network of getting contacts in your locality with ease
Tech stack
Flutter
Firebase
Unique Features
The app serves 3 main purposes

Unlike an agency, using the app to find a service will charge you nothing
The app provides further specifications like age requirement/eligibility or experience requirement/eligibility
It creates a mini social network and makes your persons of interest more easy to come into contact with
Progress so far
The user interface has been developed as close to completeness as possible using flutter (front end)
For each person who creates an account, his/her details are added to the database
If the data of a person is already existing in the database it will be displayed
Future Implementation
Creating a network of interconnectivity amongst users and adding further backend functionality
App deployment
